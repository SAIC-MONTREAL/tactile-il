# Ikea Shopping List

## Shelves
- [Kallax + 2 cabinets](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/kallax-shelf-unit-with-doors-s59197453/) (brown colour is probably best)
    - the cabinets come with a very small knob that would be interesting to test on, probably quite difficult

## Cabinet inserts
- [Kallax cabinet inserts](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/kallax-insert-with-door-white-stained-oak-effect-30324507/) x2 (same as ones above)
- [Kallax handleless cabinet](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/kallax-insert-with-door-pale-turquoise-60496738/) x2?

## Drawer Inserts
- [Kallax drawer inserts](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/kallax-insert-with-2-drawers-white-stained-oak-effect-50324511/#content) x2?

## Handles\*\*
All of these are like $5-10 for a pair, so I'm imagining we may as well just buy a bunch?

\*\*On second thought, Francois says he has many handles already, so we can probalby hold off on these for now!!
- [Small hook style](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/billsbro-handle-white-20334314/) (difficult)
- [Same as above, but wider](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/billsbro-handle-white-90334315/) (still difficult)
- [Large(r) knob](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/bagganaes-knob-black-90338417/) (difficult, but less so than the default kallax cabinet ones)
- [Push opener](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/utrusta-push-opener-80230224/) (easier? but two stage task, and also not sure how "springy" they would be...interesting either way)
- [Flat knob](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/orrnaes-knob-stainless-steel-color-30236153/) (difficult)
    - From one of the reviews: "I find this item to be too small for a kitchen cabinet door. Finger grip is difficult. I bought a sample to try it out and chose not to buy any more. Thanks!" --perfect
- [Large handle](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/bagganaes-handle-black-80338413/) (easy, same as I used previously, but even policies without contact sensing would often slip off)
- [Another hook style](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/eneryda-cup-cabinet-pull-black-50347517/) (medium)
